Your files should go in this folder, which should be renamed to files/ if you want to use it.

I prefer to use the same folder structure as the target system, but this may not work for you if you're using multiple architectures.

The etc/apt/sources.list.d/newrelic.list file is here as an example, it is not maintained.
